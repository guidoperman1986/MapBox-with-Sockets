# Mapbox

## Mapbox App

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Description

This is an App to show a map and create/delete markers on it. It works with sockets so if you have many browser tabs opened and you move a marker in one of them, this marker will change its position in all of them.
